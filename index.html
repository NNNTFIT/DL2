    <p><span style ="color: rgb(82,37,12);">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the RoofJr. such a smashing success!</span>After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
    <p>I've started putting up a <a href="slide1.html">slide show</a> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.</p>
    <p>Once again:<span style ="color: rgb(82,37,12);">BRAVO!!!</span>  -- Mrs.Juroszek</p>
